ok so during our first few matches he did well proper spacing, punishing my slides, good pressure, not randomly throwing out Dps and proper AA. 
But as the matches progessed i noticed that he does the same combos and he has a hard time playing patient, reading mix ups and dealing with corner pressure. 
Also for a Ken of his rank i feel that he's lacking a lot of the repitoire that most kens of the same rank do.
For example; after a hkd most kens wil do a meaty med or heav tatsu on a persons wu to get a cross-up situation and another oki reset, he didnt really utilize Kens shimmies and there were instances where he could have utilized DP but didnt at all missing out on damage that could have made the world of difference in the outcome of the matches.  Now one thing i do have to add is that maybe its a lack of the mu knowledge but he didnt seem comfortable fighting my Vega after a while. Hes not bad but i feel that he needs more polishing
